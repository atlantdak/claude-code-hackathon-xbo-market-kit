# 2026-02-26 — Sparkline Ticker & Slippage UX Redesign

## Summary

Two major features developed in parallel worktree branches. The sparkline ticker
replaced hardcoded fake SVG sparklines with algorithmically generated trend
visualizations using a constrained random walk algorithm. The slippage UX redesign
(parallel session in `feature/slippage-ux-redesign` branch) overhauled the
calculator interface with dropdown symbol/side selectors, PairCatalog service,
and context-based Interactivity API state management.

## Time Tracking

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Sparkline Ticker (feature/sparkline-ticker branch) | ~60min |
| Slippage UX Redesign (feature/slippage-ux-redesign branch) | ~60min |
| Documentation (worklog + README + metrics) | ~10min |
| **Total active session time** | **~130min** |

## Completed

### Task 9: Sparkline Ticker (feature/sparkline-ticker)

- [x] `SparklineGenerator` class with seeded deterministic RNG (Lehmer LCG)
- [x] Constrained random walk algorithm for realistic price series generation
- [x] SVG point rendering with configurable dimensions, stroke width, padding
- [x] Trend direction detection (bullish/bearish/neutral) from price series
- [x] Integration into `TickerShortcode` — gradient SVG defs, Interactivity API context
- [x] Trend-based CSS: gradient fill and stroke colors (green/red/gray)
- [x] Ring buffer in JavaScript for progressive point replacement on live updates
- [x] `renderSvgPoints()` JS mirror of PHP SVG rendering for client-side updates
- [x] Rebuilt CSS bundle with sparkline trend styles
- [x] 22 new unit tests covering edge cases, JSON serialization, gradient ID uniqueness

### Task 10: Slippage UX Redesign (feature/slippage-ux-redesign)

- [x] Dropdown symbol and side selectors replacing raw text inputs
- [x] PairCatalog service for trading pair discovery
- [x] Context-based Interactivity API state management
- [x] Improved UX flow for slippage calculation
- [x] 8 commits implementing the full redesign

### Quality

- [x] PHPUnit: 49 tests, 798 assertions — all pass (22 new sparkline tests)
- [x] PHPStan level 6: 0 new errors
- [x] PHPCS: clean after auto-fix

## Decisions

- **Constrained random walk algorithm** — Generates realistic-looking price series by applying bounded random steps to a starting price. Each step is clamped to prevent runaway drift while maintaining natural variance.
- **Seeded deterministic RNG (Lehmer LCG)** — Uses a linear congruential generator seeded from symbol + timestamp. Ensures identical sparkline output for same inputs across requests, enabling HTTP caching and SSR consistency.
- **Ring buffer for progressive replacement** — Instead of redrawing the entire sparkline on each price update, uses a circular buffer that replaces the oldest point. Provides smooth visual transitions with O(1) update cost.
- **Trend direction from price series** — Compares first and last points to determine bullish/bearish/neutral trend, which drives gradient fill and stroke color selection.
- **Parallel worktree branches** — Used git worktrees to develop sparkline ticker and slippage UX redesign simultaneously in independent branches.
