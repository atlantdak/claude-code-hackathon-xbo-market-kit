# 2026-02-22 — Project Initialization + AI Workflow (Full Autonomy)

## Summary

Set up the development environment for XBO Market Kit WordPress plugin.
Designed and implemented the AI-driven development workflow with custom Claude Code plugin.
Upgraded workflow to full autonomy with executable skills, hooks, commands, TDD enforcement, and security scanning.
Hackathon project using Claude Code for AI-assisted development.

## Completed

- [x] Chose project structure (git root at `app/public/`)
- [x] Designed whitelist `.gitignore` strategy
- [x] Created product specification from initial brief
- [x] Created design document: [Project Setup Design](../plans/2026-02-22-project-setup-design.md)
- [x] Created implementation plan: [Project Setup Plan](../plans/2026-02-22-project-setup-plan.md)
- [x] Initialized git repository
- [x] Configured PHPStorm project (.idea/)
- [x] Created CLAUDE.md with project instructions and naming conventions
- [x] Created documentation structure (docs/plans, worklog, architecture)
- [x] Created setup script for WP core bootstrapping
- [x] Created plugin skeleton with composer, phpcs, phpstan, phpunit configs
- [x] Created showcase README.md for GitHub
- [x] Initial commit and push to GitHub
- [x] Designed AI development workflow: [AI Workflow Design](../plans/2026-02-22-ai-workflow-design.md)
- [x] Created implementation plan: [AI Workflow Plan](../plans/2026-02-22-ai-workflow-plan.md)
- [x] Built `xbo-ai-flow` Claude Code plugin with:
  - 5 agents: backend-dev, frontend-dev, verifier, integration-tester, reviewer
  - 4 skills: orchestrate, readme-update, worklog-update, metrics
  - Stop hook for documentation reminders
  - Metrics collection script (session-meta parser)
- [x] Initialized metrics tracking (docs/metrics/tasks.json)
- [x] Regenerated README.md as visual landing page with Mermaid diagrams, badges, metrics dashboard
- [x] Designed workflow improvements: [Workflow Improvements Design](../plans/2026-02-22-workflow-improvements-design.md)
- [x] Created implementation plan: [Workflow Improvements Plan](../plans/2026-02-22-workflow-improvements-plan.md)
- [x] Upgraded xbo-ai-flow plugin to v0.2.0 with full autonomy:
  - Rewrote 4 skills with executable step-by-step instructions (orchestrate, metrics, worklog-update, readme-update)
  - Added PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks for PHP quality gates (syntax check, auto-format)
  - Created 6 command shortcuts (/feature, /verify, /test, /review, /docs, /status)
  - Created security scanning script (WordPress-specific XSS, SQL injection, nonce, capability checks)
  - Created pre-commit validation script (syntax, debug artifacts, hardcoded secrets)
  - Updated all 5 agents with TDD enforcement and security awareness
  - Created ADR system with template and 3 initial architecture decisions
- [x] Fixed metrics collector — rewrote to parse JSONL session transcripts instead of empty session-meta files
- [x] Populated tasks.json with 4 tracked tasks and real metrics

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks completed | 4 |
| Total dev time | 3h 3m (183 min) |
| Commits | 20 |
| Sessions | 4 |
| API calls | 472 |
| Tokens (in+out) | 48,295 |
| Tokens (all incl. cache) | 46,581,473 |

## Decisions

- **Git root = `app/public/`** — Claude Code runs from here, keeps everything accessible
- **Whitelist `.gitignore`** — safer than blacklisting WP core files individually
- **Language split** — Russian for conversation, English for all persisted artifacts (stored in CLAUDE.local.md, not pushed)
- **Code quality in plugin dir** — Composer, PHPCS, PHPStan, PHPUnit inside plugin for self-contained tooling
- **Plugin naming** — `xbo-market-kit` slug, `XboMarketKit` namespace, `xbo_market_kit_` prefix
- **Hybrid AI workflow** — Superpowers for process orchestration + custom plugin for agents/metrics
- **Fully autonomous pipeline** — One command triggers brainstorm → plan → code → verify → review → ship
- **Tailwind CDN** — No npm/node build step for hackathon speed
- **Per-task metrics** — Time + tokens tracked per task in tasks.json
- **Codex CLI for review** — Reviewer agent uses `codex --approval-mode full-auto` for automated code review
- **TDD mandatory** — All implementation agents must use superpowers:test-driven-development
- **5-step verification** — phpcs → phpstan → phpunit → security → TDD compliance
- **Command shortcuts** — 6 slash commands for common actions (/feature, /verify, /test, /review, /docs, /status)
- **ADR system** — Architecture decisions documented in docs/architecture/

## Tools Used

- Claude Code (brainstorming, planning, implementation)
- Local by Flywheel (WordPress 6.9.1 environment)
- PHPStorm (IDE)
