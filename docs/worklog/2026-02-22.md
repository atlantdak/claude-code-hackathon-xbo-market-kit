Hackathon project using Claude Code for AI-assisted development.

## Completed

- [x] Chose project structure (git root at `app/public/`)
- [x] Designed whitelist `.gitignore` strategy
- [x] Created product specification from initial brief
- [x] Created design document: [Project Setup Design](../plans/2026-02-22-project-setup-design.md)
- [x] Created implementation plan: [Project Setup Plan](../plans/2026-02-22-project-setup-plan.md)
- [x] Initialized git repository
- [x] Configured PHPStorm project (.idea/)
- [x] Created CLAUDE.md with project instructions and naming conventions
- [x] Created documentation structure (docs/plans, worklog, architecture)
- [x] Created setup script for WP core bootstrapping
- [x] Created plugin skeleton with composer, phpcs, phpstan, phpunit configs
- [x] Created showcase README.md for GitHub
- [x] Initial commit and push to GitHub

## Decisions

- **Git root = `app/public/`** — Claude Code runs from here, keeps everything accessible
- **Whitelist `.gitignore`** — safer than blacklisting WP core files individually
- **Language split** — Russian for conversation, English for all persisted artifacts (stored in CLAUDE.local.md, not pushed)
- **Code quality in plugin dir** — Composer, PHPCS, PHPStan, PHPUnit inside plugin for self-contained tooling
- **Plugin naming** — `xbo-market-kit` slug, `XboMarketKit` namespace, `xbo_market_kit_` prefix

## Tools Used

- Claude Code (brainstorming, planning, implementation)
- Local by Flywheel (WordPress 6.9.1 environment)
- PHPStorm (IDE)
